# HuffmanCoding
A simple project that is able to encode and decode information using the Huffman algorithm.

### Supported commands

    - i <input file name>:       Sets the name of the input file.
    
    - o <output file name>:      Sets the name of the output file.
    
    - compress:                  Opens the input and output files, compresses the input data
                                 using the Huffman algorithm and writes it into the output file.
    
    - decompress:                Opens the input and output files, decompresses the input data
                                 using the Huffman algorithm and writes it into the output file.
    
    - exit:                      Terminates the program.
